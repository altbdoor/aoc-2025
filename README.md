_Stopped at day 7 because things are just too difficult for this old brain._
_Peeked at day 8 and 9 and find myself equally stumped._

[Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025/), done in [Golang](https://go.dev/).

## Folder structure

1. Each day has its own folder (e.g., `01`, `02`, `03`, ...).
2. Each folder contains a `main.go` file.
3. Parts of the day's solution are implemented as separate functions within the folder.
4. Input files should be placed inside the folder, e.g., `02/demo.txt` or `03/input.txt`.
5. Run a solution with:

    ```
    go run 02/main.go {part} {optional_input_file}
    ```

    - `{part}`: `1` or `2`
    - `{optional_input_file}`: defaults to `input.txt`, but can be `demo.txt` or any other file

## AI involvement
